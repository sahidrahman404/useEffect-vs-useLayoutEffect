#+title: useLayoutEffect

** useEffect vs useLayoutEffect
There are two ways to tell React to run side-effects after it renders:
1. useEffect
2. useLayoutEffect

+ useLayoutEffect runs before the browser paints the screen as you can see in the
react hook flow diagram below.
+ use useLayoutEffect over useEffect if you have a side effect that's going to
modify the DOM in a way that's observable to the users.
+ NOTE: React 18 has smoothed out the differences in the UX between useEffect
  and useLayoutEffect. That said, the simple "rule" described still applies!
